- Screw the air-valve so you can secure the air inside the air compressor

- Turn on the air compressor by pulling the on-off knob. The compressor will stop automatically
after it's full.

- Make sure that the air-pressure is on 2.5bar, if not adjust the pressure
by turning the big red knob towards the + symbol if you must increase
and towards the - symbol if you must degrease the pressure.

- After the wire cutting-stripping process is ended turn off the compressor by pushing down
the on-off knob

- Unscrew the air-valve just half way and when the air-pressure is on zero
unscrew it completely because if the air stays inside the compressor turns
into water and it can be distributed inside the wire cutting-stripping machine.

-After pulling the edge of the wire from the lower side of the reel as shown in the photo,
insert the brown 2,5mm2 ac cable into the wire cutter. Just a 1- to 1.5-cm-long tip of the wire should be left at the end.
