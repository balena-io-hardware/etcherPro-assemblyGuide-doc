## AC harness

Find the [BoM](https://github.com/balena-io-hardware/etcherPro-assemblyGuide#ac-harness) on the assembly guide.

#### Steps

1. Cut as many 14cm cables (yellow, blue, brown) as specified in the production-manufacturing order by
selecting program 1 on the cable-cutting-stripping machine and put it in the small blue box as shown in the photo.
2. Cut as many 40cm cables (yellow, blue, brown) as specified in the production-manufacturing order by
selecting program 2 on the cable-cutting-stripping machine and put it in the large blue box as shown in the photo.

| Blue AC wires | <img src="../output/Batch-production-photos/Blue-wires-in-the-box.jpg" width="250"> |
| Brown AC wires | <img src="../output/Batch-production-photos/Brown-wires-in-the-box.jpg" width="250"> |

* For further instructions follow the [AC-DC wire-cutting-stripping guide](https://github.com/balena-io-hardware/etcherPro-assemblyGuide/blob/master/output/Sub-processes/AC-DC-wire-cutting-stripping.md)
3. Keep the box containing the short wire of one colour of wires on the workbench where the crimping machine is,
to your right, and store the remaining boxes underneath the bench, as indicated in the photo.

</p>

4. Place the AC-wire's small box used for the assembly line in your left side as shown in the photo.

</p>

5. Bring the small box with the quick terminals to the crimping machine's left side.

</p>

6. Start to crimp the wires and each one you complete place them by colour to the box as shown in the photo.

</p>

* Follow the crimping process instructions [here](https://github.com/balena-io-hardware/etcherPro-assemblyGuide/blob/master/output/Sub-processes/Cable-crimping.md)

7. Repeat the process also for the other colour of the short wires.
8. Place the short wires in the designated location on the production shelf once you have completed using all the colours.
Do not move them unless there is a cause to do so and the warehouse manager is informed of it. The assembly warehouse has a wayfinding map
in the inventory software system.

9. Repeat the same process for the long wires as well.

## Bottom subassembly.

Here is the guide for the [BoM + instructions](https://github.com/balena-io-hardware/etcherPro-assemblyGuide#Bottom-subassembly)

#### Steps

1. Apply 20 Bottom shells across the workbench.
2. Use the file tool to remove any excess plastic between the gaps if any.

</p>

3. Use one of the Bosch screwdrivers and countersink drill bit 6.3mm to countersunk
the Ethernet and M3 screw holes. Apply speed 1 and torque 1 for the Bosch screwdriver.
4. Apply the metal labels to the whole Batch.
* Tip: After you have finished this step to the whole batch
the best way to make sure that the labels are attached properly take the cleaning cotton rag
and push them to its place by wiping them off removing also by any chance fingerprints.
5. Turn over the shells having the Ethernet ports facing towards to you and prepare for the next Step.
* Tip: Each time you finish pushing in place the metal label for each shell, turn it over to save time for
the next step.
6. Take the left and right Ethernet blind covers along with the Bosch screwdriver with the proper tip
and the No 2.2 6.5 screws and keep them beside you in the assembly line's cart. Begin the installation.
The arrows on the blind covers indicate whether they should be put on the left or the right side.
After installation leave the shells exactly as they were on the bench.
* Tip: Load also the PSUs in the cart along with the foam double sided tape so you can begin the
installation as soon as you end installing the Ethernet blind covers.
7. Apply the PSUs to the bottom shells according the guide's instructions. Keep the whole carton PSU's box
in the cart beside you having the carton flaps of the box removed as you can see in the photo below so it's easier and faster to take them
from the box. Discard the carton box-flaps to the trash and keep the cart clean. Return the parts from the previous steps to the assembly warehouse.

8. Apply the entry modules following the assembly guide's instructions.

</p>

9. Apply the AC wires to the PSU. Load the cart with the big and small AC for production boxes.
Have the big box laying over along the cart's upper layer and the small box in front of it as indicated in the photo.
Take the Bosch screwdriver with the proper tip. Take out the plastic cover on the AC side of the PSU and keep it aside.
Leave them straight by having the stripped edge of the sort wire on the left side of the screw and other edge of the longer wire on the right side and then screw them in place.
Start from the yellow wires and then move on to the blue and last to the brown wire following the same order, make sure that all the wires are properly
secured in its place. Apply the edges with the quick terminals to the entry modules by applying first the short and then the long wires.
The preferred and the most efficient order of applying the shortest wires to the right C13 side entry module is:
- Yellow
- Blue
- Brown
Follow the opposite order of applying the longest ones to the C14 left side entry module.
