- Thick cardboard

## Step 2 Prepare for the UV-curing process


- Apply the EMC protection plastic material on the working bench
- Wear protective gloves and goggles
- Bring and keep the UV-curing station next to you and turn on both of the  LED lamps
- Suck resin with the syringe without the needle being installed, ¼ full
- Shield instantly the resin bottle
- Install the needle by pointing upwards

- Hold the syringe upwards and press the plunger slowly to remove excess air always covered by a paper towel

- Be sure that your protective gloves are clean without any remaining resin on them to avoid messing up the Top-shell


## Step 3 Curing process


- Place the top shell upside down with the slots facing away from you
- Place the cardboard underneath the slots

- Direct the needle close and above the hole and press the plunger extremely gently and slowly a tiny drop is enough. Be careful because the needle may be dripping in just holding it downwards and sometimes the resin is being applied from hole to hole without even the need to press the plunger. The holes should be perfectly clear, if plastic peels blocks the holes remove them using a tweezers

- After the resin is being applied to 16 holes place the top shell halfway through to the curing station making sure that both LED lamps are pointing to the resin

- The time required to apply 16 drops of resin is enough to cure the resin on the previous shell.  You can use a dry needle to gently push the cured resin to make sure it feels solid and therefore is properly cured.
- Repeat process


## Step 4 wrap it up


- Turn off the UV LED lamps of the curing station and keep it safe
- Put in place the resin bottle, the cardboard, the protection EMC plastic material and the goggles
- Don’t refill the resin bottle with the remaining resin from the syringe if any, just discard the whole syringe as it is. The reason is that the resin is being cured during the whole process and cannot be used again
