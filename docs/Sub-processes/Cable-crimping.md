Align the cable with the terminal to the crimper and make sure that it's in the right place

# Cable crimping
EtcherPro v1

## Step 1. Pre-installation AC cables deployment.

- In the assembly warehouse, each component used in manufacturing and refilling has its own storage shelf.
Everything you require can be found there, along with the terminals.

</p>

- Fill the 2 small boxes with Fork and quick terminals,

</p>

- Place the terminal-containing boxes on the workbench to your left-hand side, next to the crimping machine.

- Place one of the AC boxes on the workbench to your right-hand side, next to the crimping machine
based on the length and colour that you want to use.

</p>

- Place the production AC wire box depending on the length you are working on
beside you on the carton box.

</p>

* Tip: Have a small garbage can nearby so you may throw away the wires' protection caps.

## Step 2. Crimp the quick-terminal to the AC cables

- Take a 40 or 14cm cable at your hand and remove the protecting cap with trimmed insulation

- Take one quick terminal from the boxes you have on your left-hand side

- Remove the protecting cap and place the terminal into the bare 9mm copper all the way in

- Align the cable with the terminal to the crimper and make sure that it’s in the right place

- Push the pedal with your foot to crimp after you make SURE that your left hand(after you have aligned the fork terminal) is away from the crimper

- Make sure that the quick terminal is well pressured by holding the cable’s edge and the terminal and stretch both sides. Proceed to the next one.

- Complete the batch and place it in its storage box and back to the dedicated storage shelf

## Step 3. Crimp Fork-terminals to the DC cables

</p>
- The deploy of the DC cables is exactly the same with the AC-cables

</p>

- Remove the protection cap on the 7mm side
- Take 1 Fork-terminal at your left hand and place it to the bare 7mm copper strings all the way in.

  - **IMPORTANT** The copper wire should protrude from the terminal’s insulation about 2mm,
like in the picture below If that is not the case,
make sure you are using the 7mm end and the cable is properly inserted into the terminal.

</p>

- Repeat the process for all the batch
- After completing the batch place them in the storage box and back to the dedicated storage shelf
